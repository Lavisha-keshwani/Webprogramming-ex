    <h1>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a diameter of about 12,742 km and a surface covered by 71% water. The Earthâ€™s atmosphere, primarily nitrogen and oxygen, protects life and regulates temperature. Earth has a diverse range of ecosystems and a magnetic field that shields it from solar radiation. It orbits the Sun in about 365.25 days and has a tilted axis, causing seasonal changes.</h1>
