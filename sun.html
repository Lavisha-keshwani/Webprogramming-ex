    <h1>The Sun is a massive star at the center of our solar system, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core, producing light and heat that sustain life on Earth. The Sun's surface temperature is around 5,500°C, while its core reaches about 15 million°C. It goes through an 11-year solar cycle, influencing solar activity such as sunspots and solar flares. The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and will remain stable for another 5 billion years before evolving into a red giant.</h1>
